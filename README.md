### Apple MacBook Pro M1 Pro Chip users!
If you are using the The Apple M1 Pro Chip, this repository will not work. The M1 Pro Chip ARM64 architecture has broken underlying software used by RStudio. Please try this repository instead, https://github.com/Stephen-McDaniel/SmartDesktop-RStudio-M1-Chip-Experimental.

## 🚀 Features

* YakData SmartDesktop with RStudio Server Open Source is the smart way to develop R programs, Shiny web apps & RMarkdown docs on your desktop. It includes R 4.1.3 from the Rocker project and the RStudio IDE as a web app all wrapped neatly into Docker.
* Save hours of time to get up and running with a complete desktop IDE for R. 
* Preloaded with the tidyverse, verse and geospatial-related tools from the R rocker-org project! Includes tex & publishing-related packages from verse.
* Designed to install packages from RStudio Package Manager on a fixed date. Easily change this in Rprofile.site. Rapid installation of most packages as this image is based on Ubuntu.
* Easy access to all the RStudio configuration and startup values.
* The end of complex uninstall/upgrade paths for R and RStudio on your laptop/desktop system. 
* Easily recreate an identical environment on another system.
* Run multiple versions of R side-by-side with multiple SmartDesktop project directories.
* Define various environments for a particular R version with multiple docker-compose files.
* Control resources used by your R sessions with docker-compose. No more system lock because an R session unexpectedly stole all your desktop resources.
* Pause and restart a long-running R session with Docker Desktop!

## 🧰 Install and setup

We recommend a desktop with a minimum of 1 CPU, 4 GB of RAM and at least 20 GB of free disk storage.  Your project needs may vary widely based on your apps, usage patterns and data volumes. This repository is strictly intended for local, desktop usage. The running container is not secured with encryption.

1. Install Docker and docker-compose on your system.
   a. Install Docker Desktop on Windows at https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/, or
   b. Install Docker Desktop on Mac at https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/Stephen-McDaniel/YakData-SmartDesktop-RStudio/archive/refs/tags/4.1.3.zip
   ). 
3. Unzip this repository and move it to the desired location on your computer. For example, on my Mac, it is at /Users/yakdata-stephen/Documents/Development/YakData-SmartDesktop-for-RStudio
4. Open the terminal on your computer and change directories to the install location. Now navigate one directory down to apps.
   ```cd /Users/yakdata-stephen/Documents/Development/YakData-SmartDesktop-for-RStudio```
5. With one command you will download the needed images (one time only) and start the RStudio Server. This will take a while, depending on your internet speed and your computer speed. After the first time, it will typically take 7-20 seconds to start.
   ```docker-compose up -d```
6. Check that it is running. 
   ```docker ps; ``` View the logs. 
   ```docker logs;```
7. Navigate to your new RStudio IDE from your favorite browser. 
   ```http://localhost:4120/```
8. Enjoy a portable, reproducible R experience!

Internal to Ubuntu, RStudio maps all content to **/home/rstudio**, which appears in this project tree as **/yakdata/content**.

When installing new packages from the RStudio *Packages* tab -> *Install* button, be certain to change the dropdown to the project tree location, **/yakdata/site-library/R/4.1.3**. If you don't use the docker mounted volume path, your installed libraries will disappear once you stop and restart the docker container.



## 🔒 Running this securely on a remote system

If you would like to run this on a remote server, I strongly recommend locking down all ports on your server except a port for a VPN server and a port for SSH terminal connection. Then, install a VPN server on your remote system to secure your connection from your desktop, a leading one on Github is https://hub.docker.com/r/kylemanna/openvpn  

If you use a remote server approach, we also recommend adding a password to RStudio. Change the environment section in docker-compose to replace the current setting with 
```      - PASSWORD=MyPasswordHere``` 
If you add a password, CHANGE the one on the above line. The user name for logging into the IDE is "rstudio".

An alternative remote server approach is to use the [YakData SmartManager for ShinyProxy](https://github.com/Stephen-McDaniel/SmartManager-for-ShinyProxy), which includes RStudio Server Open Source along with many other valuable systems for development and secure sharing of Shiny apps, RMarkdown documents and more.
